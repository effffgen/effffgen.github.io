Hey there!

Here will be my small blog, if I ever gather enough time and materials to post something here.

To be honest, I always liked how people with technical background created blogs and posted some awesome things, some of those posts were absolutely captivating, full of useful information. 
I personally believe that I learned a lot due to those posts.

I consider myself to be just a beginner in more ways than one, but I might know more than other people in some areas. And if something that I post here helps anyone, I will be delighted.

Well then, most likely, in the near future I'll post here regarding my shenanigans while tinkering with Danganronpa. Recently, a Russian fan translation was published for Danganronpa 2 and I wanted to try and port it on PSP.
Also I might take a look at original Steins;Gate and check whether it is ported on PSP already or not. It's been about 6 years since Russian translation was created.

On that note, wish me luck!
